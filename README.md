# PSN Time Tracker for iOS

SwiftUI Implementation of the [PSN Time Tracker App](https://github.com/samudebug/psn-time-tracker)

I did this mainly to study how to create apps with SwiftUI and consuming APIs.

I wasn't able to replicate the login process from the Flutter App using a WebView, so it's been replaced with a manual step-by-step instructions when you first open the App.
